    <h1>Interview Questions :</h1>
    <p><b>1. In components-based architecture, what is a spec file?</b><br>
    <br>A spec file contains test cases written to ensure that a specific component, function, or module behaves as expected. The term "spec" is short for specification, as it defines what the component should do.<br>
    <br><b>2. What is the name of the tree in DOM?</b><br>
    <br>N-Array tree<br>
    <br><b>3. First step to make a repository in Git?</b><br>
    <br><b>git init</b><br>
    <br><b>4. Is Git centralized or distributed?</b><br>
    <br>Distributed<br>
    <br><b>5. Why is Git fast in executing the commands typed?</b><br>
    <br>Git is developed in C language.<br>
    <br><b>6. How is the staging area called before push?</b><br>
    <br>Caching area<br>
    <br><b>7. If the root folder is called a repository, what is the sub-folder in the repository called as?</b><br>
    <br>Not (folder, repository, sub-folder)<br>
    <br><b>8. If h1.../h1 is given in the HTML file without the basic structure of HTML, what is the output?</b><br>
    <br>The content inside the h1 tag (As it is the HTML file, it takes the basic structure automatically).<br>
    <br><b>9. If title.../title is given in the HTML file without the basic structure of HTML, what is the output?</b><br>
    <br>The content inside the title tag will be the title of the tab (As it is the HTML file, it takes the basic structure automatically).<br>
    <br><b>10. If h1.../h1 and title.../title are given in the HTML file without the basic structure, what is the output and why does the title tag come in the body?</b><br>
    <br>It will display the h1 line in the body, and the title tag will also appear in the body because the HTML structure is incomplete, and the browser interprets it as part of the body.</p>
