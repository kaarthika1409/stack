        <h3>3. How the title tag is fetched to head and h1 is fetched to body when rendering a HTML file which has no structure ?</h3>
        <p>When rendering an HTML file with no structure, the browser automatically places the title tag into the head and the h1 tag into the body based on HTML parsing rules and defaults.</p>

        <h3>5. Why there is three dots in if...else and do...while ?</h3>
        <p>The three dots (...) in if...else and do...while in documentation or examples are placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. 
            They imply that additional statements or code blocks should be added in those places.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>7. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?</h3>
        <p>The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>8. Why Components should start with Capital letter?</h3>
